	<p>I am believer that client relations are the key to the success of any business. As the Director of Operations
	   for a political consulting firm in Atlanta, I know first-hand the benefits of working closely with clients and
	   ensuring that their expectations are met. Beyond that, I know that open-communication is key to effectively
	   manage business operations.</p>
