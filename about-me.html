	<h2> A Bit About Me </h2>
	
	<p><img class="headshot" src="headshot.jpg" alt="Stephen Hammond" height="150" width="150" align="left"><img/> A bit about me: at Georgia Tech I majored in Business Administration with a concentration in marketing. While there, I interned at the 
	Douglas-Coffee County Chamber of Commerce and Hurst Public Relations. After that campaign, I went on to work with the Georgia House of 
	Representatives in the Office of the Clerk of the House. My latest position was working as the Director of Operations at The Oblander Group,
	a political and non-profit consulting firm.</p>
	
	<p> Within months of working at The Oblander Group, I was promoted to Director of Operations where I was responsible for day-to-day
	business operations, as well as event planning and marketing strategy and campaigns. Everyday, I was tasked with ensuring that all facets of a
	client's needs were met and exceeded, which is why I was the primary contact for clients. I designed e-marketing and social media campaigns,
	managed our CRM databases, and routinely developed financial reports for the state ethics commission. I also managed talent acquisition for
	the firm by recruiting, interviewing and training multiple new interns. </p>
	
	<p> I currently live in Atlanta, GA and spend my free time playing golf, reading, rooting for the Falcons and the Yellow Jackets and brewing beer. </p>
